# 🗺️ U.S. States Game

A Python game using **turtle graphics** and **pandas** to guess all 50 U.S. states.

 🎮 Gameplay

* A blank U.S. map is shown.
* Type a state name into the popup.
* ✅ Correct → name appears on the map.
* ❌ Wrong → lose 1 life (you have **3 lives**).
* Game ends when you guess all states or run out of lives.

## 📘 Learning Feature

* Uses CSV data (`50_states.csv`) for state names and coordinates.
* At the end, generates `states_to_learn.csv` with the states you missed.


## ▶️ Run the Game

pip install pandas
python main.py



Would you like me to also make a **1-line GitHub tagline** (like: *“Guess the U.S. states game built with Python, Turtle, and Pandas”*)?
